# Assembly Decompiler
An Assembly to Python decompiler based off of the ACSL's implementation of Assembly

# Usage
Store your Assembly code in the file ```in.asm```, then run the ```main.py``` file, and it should run fine.<br>

# Common Problems
<li>Make sure your Assembly code has an <code>END</code> statement at the bottom.</li>
<li>Make sure you check for immediate data in your Assembly.</li>

# Warnings
Using this program may be considered cheating and can have you disqualified from the ACSL.<br>
Furthermore, due to the style of ACSL problems, it is not recommended you use this program as it will not give you insights as to what the answer may be for a question, only calculations.
