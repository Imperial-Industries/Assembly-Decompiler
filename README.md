# Assembly-Decompiler
An Assembly to Python decompiler based off of the ACSL's implementation of Assembly

Just run ```main.py``` and then input your lines. The first line must be an integer that says how many lines are in the Assembly program. <br>
The rest of the lines are the space seperated Assembly lines.<br>
The converted program will be in ```out.py```.<br>
Note that some programs using branches may require additional positional debugging.
